# Concepts of a Language Course

After reviewing my [Chinese manual](https://www.editions-ellipses.fr/accueil/10457-n-hao-ma-premiers-pas-en-chinois-mandarin-a1-a2-9782340038684.html?srsltid=AfmBOopRUlOsr0ffdePtTNsupkNRExMX17DO2QiTOMAt_D72wAh4Qsx_) as well as my [japanese language school material](https://www.coto-language.com/product-page/beginner-6-intensive-course-materials-2020), this is the vision I have of a generalized modelisation for a language course.

## Planning
Language courses can have planning. Those allows to have a clear idea in mind of when they are going to reach their language goals. They can be divided into two categories:
- **Course Planning**: Provides with an overall sense of when students are going to reach their intended level, and vaguely see what they will learn in each unit.
- **Unit Planning**: Describes more detailly what students are expected to learn and practice for daily/weekly for one unit.

## Course Units
Course units are the materials the students learn and practice to step forward on their journey. They can optionnally have a preview, to have an idea of what they will learn in the coming days, but more importantly, they have elements to learn and exercises to help them remember those elements. 

### Preview
A preview helps students have a clear idea of what they will learn. This means giving some context on what type of vocabulary will be used in the unit (tourism, work, friends...), as well as defining clear objectives of what characters, grammar, conjugation will be taught.
- **Description**: Introduces the unit to a student, it gives information on the domain of vocabulary, the grammar, characters that will be taught
- **Objectives**: Gives a more direct explanation of what will be learned in the lesson, and what level students will have at the end.

### Learn
The Learning section of what a student will learn during a unit. It can be composed by the following types of elements but all of those might not be in it due to changes between units and languages.
- **Vocabulary**: Represents a word or term to know by heart. It's composed of a term, it's translated version and its prononciation. However, all languages are different, and some might require the same term in different alphabet.
- **Grammar Sheet**: Is an explanation with title and example defining a language concept like how to put a verb to the past, how to create a passive sentence and so on.
- **Calligraphy**: Can be present in a language course if the learning language has a different writing system compared to the student language. 

### Exercise
- **True/False**
- **Translate**
- **Fill the blank**
- **Question answering**
- **Rewording**
- **Writing essay**
- **Conversation**
- **Calligraphy**
