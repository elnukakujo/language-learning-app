"""Schema/to_dict() parity check for Character — the Phase 4 serialization contract.

Today input validation (CharacterDict, Pydantic) and API output (Character.to_dict(),
hand-written) are two independent definitions of the same shape. They can drift
silently. This test pins the current field sets and the KNOWN gaps between them,
so any *new* drift (a field added to one side but not the other) fails loudly
instead of surfacing as a subtle frontend bug.

KNOWN_GAPS documents real, pre-existing asymmetries found while auditing this:
- Character.to_dict() calls `super().to_dict(include_relations=False)`, which
  means tags/sources are NEVER included in Character's output regardless of the
  include_relations argument passed to Character.to_dict() itself. CharacterDict
  declares tags/sources (inherited from BaseElementDict) since it's also used for
  input. This is a latent bug in the cooperative to_dict() MRO chain, not
  something this test should paper over — fix it deliberately, separately from
  this net, since fixing it changes the live API response shape.
- to_dict() also emits `calligraphy`, a relation CharacterDict doesn't model
  (Vocabulary/Grammar-style features aren't part of the Character creation payload).
- `language_id` is accepted on create (CharacterDict) but never appears in
  to_dict()'s output — a character's own API response doesn't say which
  language it belongs to. Also a real gap, also a live-response-shape change
  to make deliberately rather than as a side effect of this test.

Follow-up: once ready to unify, replace Character.to_dict() with
CharacterDict.model_validate(character, from_attributes=True) for responses,
fix the tags/sources gap as part of that change (verify the new shape against
the actual frontend before shipping), and delete this test in favor of just
using the schema directly.
